## tipmedash.com - A fast and easy way to tip online

One of the current problems of the internet is that most of good content is rewarded to creators by showcasing publicity to users resulting in a dirty and unpleasant experience. Sites as Pexels.com are an example of what the future of the internet could look like. A clean site with outstanding content and passionate photographers that are incentivize by voluntary donations from users.

When third parties are involved the connection of the creator and the supporter feels distant and probably inexistant, by the contrary, when people tip with Dash they feel closer and more connected. Publicity badly targeted suddenly is no longer the best way of making money online.
