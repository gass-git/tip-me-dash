## tipmedash.com - A fast and easy way to tip online

One of the current problems of the internet is that most of good content is rewarded to creators by showcasing publicity to users, in most cases with content they do not want to see. Sites as Pexels.com are an example of what the future of the internet could look like. A clean site with quality content and passionate photographers that are incentivize by voluntary donations from users.

When third parties are involved, creator and supporters feel disconected. By the contrary, P2P support makes people feel closer and more connected. Publicity badly targeted suddenly is no longer the best way of receiving support online.
